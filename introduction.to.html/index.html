    <!--This is question two-->
    <p>This is my first webpage. My name is Tonye Denenu and I'm part of the CapacityBay full stack web devevlopment; Cohort 4. I am new to tech and this has been an enlightening and challenging course so far. Fortunately, CapacityBay has professional instructors and it has made my journey much easier. The introduction to html has been very insightful. It's like studying the structure of the internet, if I may say. The little challenge I'm experiencing is the time we hold our class. Learning after hours is not for the faint hearted because I'm mostly tired and sleepy after all the hustle and bustle of the day. Nevertheless, I strive to keep up because this opportunity shouldn't go to waste. If this is the price I have to pay, then I'm here for it. CapacityBay team has been kind and very supportive since the inception of this course and I am so thankful for that. I'll do my best to keep with the course and get to the finish line. I need all the focus I can get for the next eight months. The major challenge for the students located in Nigeria is the cost of data and our network providers. Some students experience network glitch during classes and that results in them not participating. So they end up relying on the class recording and this affects their attendance which will cause them to be dropped from the course. The cost of data subscription ia another factor. Hopefully we'll do our due dilligence and everything will fall in line. The other factor is supply of power. The is the biggest challenge for Nigerian students. We have limited power supply and there has been a hike in the cost of petrol so this has caused us limited hours to work and practice on our system. I will do what I can to the best of my abilities to meet up the requirements for this course. Thank you CapacityBay for giving me this gift.</p>
